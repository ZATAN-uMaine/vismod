            <h2>The Tallest Public Bridge Observatory in the World</h2>
            <p> The Penobscot Narrows Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge over the Penobscot River in Prospect, Maine. It
              replaced the Waldo-Hancock Bridge, which was built in 1931. </p>
            <p> The Penobscot Narrows Bridge began construction in May 2003, built by Reed & Reed, Inc. / Cianbro
              Joint Venture. It was completed in 2006 and as of 2024 is the tallest public bridge observatory in the
              world. </p>
            <p> The bridge's observatory offers breathtaking panoramic views of the surrounding area, including the
              Penobscot River and the beautiful Maine landscape. Visitors can enjoy the stunning scenery from the
              observatory's glass-walled elevator or the outdoor observation deck. </p>

            <h2>Unique Cable System</h2>
            <p> The Penobscot Narrows Bridge features a unique cable system. It uses a Figg Cable-Stay Cradle System.
              This allows cables to be "easily" replaced, which in turn provides an opportunity for experimentation.
            </p>
            <p> The following groups all worked together to install the experimental carbon fiber composite cable
              strands (CFCS) on the bridge: </p>

            <p> They installed experimental carbon fiber composite cable strands (CFCS) on the bridge. The CFCS were
              installed at stays 2, 10, and 17 on the north pylon, with 2 CFCS per stay. </p>
            <p> <strong> It is important to note these are non-structural (extra cables), and do not affect the
                structural integrity of the bridge. </strong> </p>
            <p> The CFCS strands are monitored using a structural health monitoring system that includes sensors to
              measure CFCS strand force, changes in strain, load-chair deflections, and temperature at the anchorage
              locations and exterior. </p>

            <h2> The Purpose of the CFCS
            </h2>
            <p> The reasoning behind the installation of the CFCS was to study the long-term behavior and durability of
              CFCS in a
              real-world cable-stayed bridge application. The Penobscot Narrows Bridge serves as a "living laboratory"
              for this study. The Carbon Fiber Composite Strands are manufactured by Tokyo Rope Co. of Japan and are
              composed of
              six helically wound rods wound over a central rod, bound in epoxy resin. The anchorage system for these
              cables
              a threaded socket and an Anchor nut.</p>
            <p> Steel strands are typically used in cable-stayed bridges, but CFCS offer potential advantages such as
              higher strength-to-weight ratio, corrosion resistance, and ease of installation. Carbon Fiber is also
              very lightweight. Maintence related to
              corrosion alone costs the U.S. approximately $276 billion, yearly. The data from this effort may prove
              carbon fiber as a more viable material
              for infrastructure, as opposed to steel, then a lot of taxpayer money can be saved. </p>

            <h2>Structural Health Monitoring System</h2>
            <p> A structural health monitoring system was implemented to monitor the CFCS strands over the long term.
              The monitoring objectives are to detect variations in force and strain on the CFCS at the anchorage
              locations and correlate the measurements with ambient temperature. </p>
            <p>The monitoring system includes sensors to measure:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>CFCS strand force using load cells at the strand anchors</li>
              <li> Changes in strain using fiber optic strain (FOS) sensors attached to the strands </li>
              <li> Load-chair deflections using displacement transducers (LVDTs) </li>
              <li>Temperature at the anchorage locations and exterior</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The data from these monitoring systems is transmitted to the pylon base of the bridge through Fiber
              Optic Cables to a receiver.
              This receiver then communicates with a Computer hooked up to a WSDA Basestation, allowing for wireless
              transmission.
              Data is then transitted from the Data Acquisition System to a Google Drive.

            <h2>Long Term Goal</h2>
            <p>
              The long-term plan is to continue monitoring the CFCS strands to
              assess their performance and durability over time. Recommendations
              include transitioning to a continuous online monitoring system for
              both the CFCS and steel strands.
            </p>
            <p>
              In summary, the Penobscot Narrows Bridge is serving as a "living
              laboratory" to study the long-term behavior and durability of CFCS in
              a real-world cable-stayed bridge application, enabled by the
              comprehensive structural health monitoring system that has been
              implemented.
